Comments on the video critique her performance; some seem to take pains to be critical but kind (for example, user “harmony burrell” posted 6 years ago: “good but skipped words and u shouldnt turn it into like pop just sing it how it should be but faster bravo good tone”); other comments indicate a familiarity with the performer’s voice and growth as a singer. She performs the first verse only.",

    "narrative": "The video was directed by Debbie Allen. It begins with a monologue by Louis Gossett, Jr. The video features noted African American singers such as Dionne Warwick, BeBe Winans, Jeffrey Osborne, Bobby Brown (who also dances), and others (featured on Melba Moore’s album, “Soul Exposed”), and includes dancing by Jasmine Guy. All of the performers are dressed in white and are positioned in front of a fuchsia background with light blue steps on which they stand or sit. Three to four male dancers accompany Guy. A small chorus of children, also dressed in white, joins the singers and dancers. Only the first and third verses of the song are performed (See Jessika Banzouzi, Aloe Blacc). The video ends with Gossett intoning, “keep hope alive.” As noted in a previous entry, Moore returns to the idea of a communal performance with this arrangement. Allen’s video broadens this communal work to include movement, building on the idea of embodied performance and embedding a dance lexicon in this video. ",

She is accompanied first by piano, but as the song progresses, she is joined by other voices and instruments, building the song from a solo speaking voice to a group of voices and instruments; in a sense, this performance returns us the idea of communal performance of the song as it was originally imagined by Johnson. Various artists take turn in a call-and response style (“Sing a song”). Singers include: Dionne Warwick, Stevie Wonder, The Clark Sisters, Freddie Jackson, Anita Baker, Bobby Brown, Howard Hewett, Take 6, Stephanie Mills, BeBe and CeCe Winans, and Jeffrey Osborne.

Jordan provides a preamble to the dramatic recitation of the song, in which she intones, “These are our songs of joy and sadness. They were given life by slaves who toiled in the fields of America. Sweat on their brows, hope in their hearts. These are our songs of happiness and sorrow. The soul of blackfolk, coupled with religious fervor and vigorous rhythms that hint of their African heritage. These are our songs of hope.” The video features various still images of Jordan. She performs the first and second verses, and changes some of the lyrics and adds her own “prayer” to the performance. We might consider Jordan’s performance on this album as a preamble to René Marie’s controversial creative re-composition of the National Anthem in Denver (2008).",

Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis provide commentary for the video. In this clip, the singers record the first verse. Green provided a playful presence at the event; and McDuffie notes: “Al was 8 hours late as usual, which is why it’s dark when he’s arriving. It’s a fun-filled sneak peek inside what goes on (or used to go on) in the recording studio.”",

    "narrative": "Uploaded in 2013 by Kuena, who performs in the video. This is a self-recorded upload, in which Kuena performs the first verse of the song, in observation of Juneteenth. She notes in the video that she is recording it 11 p.m., which is \"late\" for her, but that she \"needed to record it...because today is a very special day in history.\" Kuena's commitment to observe Juneteenth through her performance of \"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\" highlights the ways in which the song is understood to be a sonic attendant to observations of historic events significant to African Americans",

The performance was part of a multi-day ceremony that marked the return of some of the remains of the Herero and Nama people, victims of genocide carried out by the German colonial government in Namibia at the start of the twentieth century (1904-1908). Banzouzi performs the first and third verses only. The video was created by AFROTAK cyberNomads, founded by Adetoun Kuppers Adebisi.",

The song appears to have been recorded in a building hallway (possibly a school or apartment building). One commenter (Roscoe J, comments section) notes the irony of the juxtaposition of sounds: of sirens in the background, playing underneath the melody of the Black men's voices. User Prince Philipps responds “gave me chills.” The group sings only the first verse.",

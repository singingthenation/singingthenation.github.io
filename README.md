# Intro

Singing the Nation Into Being is an experimental digital humanities project that aims to stir discussion about the meaning and resonance of James Weldon Johnson and J. Rosamond Johnson's "Lift Every Voice and Sing" (1900). Also known as the "The Negro National Anthem" and "The Black National Anthem," "Lift Every Voice and Sing" was initially conceived as a poem, meant to commemorate Abraham Lincoln's birthday in 1900. Johnson and his brother J. Rosamond later transformed the text to song to honor Booker T. Washington's visit to The Stanton School in Jacksonville, Fla., where Johnson was the principal. Since Johnson's initial conception, a performance by a chorus of 500 schoolchildren, until the most recent iterations---such as Beyonc√©'s performance at Coachella---the song has remained central, in many ways, to Black American life.

Singing the Nation Into Being will develop in two phases using the minimal computing model.[^1] The first phase features a collection of video-recorded performances and mashups created by a wide range of individuals and groups demonstrating a variety of vocal and presentation stylings---from a cappella to choral performances to recitation and more---in spaces both public and private. These videos form what I call an "ephemeral archive," works created and uploaded often with a single intention, such as observation of a holiday or a meaningful date (Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday or Juneteenth), to mark a significant event (Barack Obama's election), or to demonstrate shared cultural practices (step shows and Black church services). Ephemera, generally understood as having no lasting significance or purpose, would seem a limited site for exploration both temporally and spatially, bound as they are to notions of value and relevance and permanence. This might, in turn, set limits on the kinds of discourses that surround such objects and the ways we engage with them, particularly given their proliferation, brought about in part through the process of "democratization" of the Internet and the development of ease-of-use tools, such as YouTube. But with this video collection, I argue for the salience of ephemera created by Black people, and the work they do as potential sites of memory and materiality. Engaging in a process of active reconstruction, what Toni Morrison terms rememory, I return to the spaces in which artists, groups, and everyday people locate their digital creations, in an attempt to (re)construct routes to other sites of memory that might allow us a different understanding of the resonance of "Lift Every Voice and Sing" as well as its potentialities.

A second phase of this project will examine video metadata---comments, likes, dislikes, up/down votes, number of visitors, uploader narratives, and other data that get appended to each digital object.

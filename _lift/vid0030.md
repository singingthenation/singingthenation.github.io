narrative: African American young man, identifies this as a poem, and recites it dramatically.
  He had previously read it as part of a poetry competition in February (though the
  video was uploaded in April). He emphasizes that he had to learn the entire poem
  and learned it “bit by bit by bit.” He refers to the song as “The Black National
  Anthem” and describes the meaning of the poem to him in helping him understand himself
  as an “African American male.” He performs all three verses.

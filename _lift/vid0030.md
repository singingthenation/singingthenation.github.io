narrative: An African American young man, identifies this as a poem, and recites dramatically.
  He had previously read it as part of a poetry competition in February (though the
  video was uploaded in April). He emphasizes that he had to learn the entire poem
  and learned it “bit by bit by bit.” Describes the meaning of the poem to him in
  helping him understand himself as an “African American male.” He performs all three
  verses.

video_notes: Harmonyx performs at Harmonyx A Capella workshop on August 22, 2012
narrative: 'This performance adds a “preamble” to the song: “We will not bow down
  to/ racism. / We will not bow down to / injustice,” performed in a call and-response
  style (soloist and group). The young performers then physically rearrange themselves,
  harmonizing to the tune of “Lift Every Voice and Sing” before singing the song.
  They perform only the first verse, with this arrangement and stylization.'

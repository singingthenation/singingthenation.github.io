video_title: Lift every voice and sing in ASL
video_notes: 'Nanonte Dailey teaching the signs to lift every voice and sing in ASL
  at IS 364 in Brooklyn NY.  #signs of the time.'
narrative: Teacher Nanonte Dailey teaches students at IS 364 in Brooklyn how to sign
  “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” The students are seated in chairs on either side of
  each other, forming an aisle. They are dressed in simple school uniforms--black  shirts
  and dark blue or black pants. Dailey stands in the middle, at the top of the aisle.
  They sing and sign an up-tempo version of the song by a female vocalist. They sing
  and sign only the first verse.

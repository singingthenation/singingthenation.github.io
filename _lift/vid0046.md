narrative: 'The performance begins with opening remarks by one group member, a young
  black woman. She explains the origins of the song and explains its significance
  to African Americans; she also notes that the song applies to “all of us” in that
  it “moves us to remember and reconcile with a history of inequality in our country.”
  This is an a cappella performance and all three verses are sung. The second verse
  is performed up tempo. '

video_notes: Stanford Talisman winter show 2009. Our version is available on our 2001
  album “Passage”
narrative: The performance begins with opening remarks by one group member, a young
  black woman. She explains the origins of the song and its significance to African
  Americans; she also notes that the song applies to “all of us” in that it “moves
  us to remember and reconcile with a history of inequality in our country.” This
  is an a cappella performance and all three verses are sung. The second verse is
  performed in an up tempo style.

narrative: 'Jasmine performs the song in front of a wall on which hangs a framed image.
  She appears to be in a home environment. Comments on the video critique her performance;
  some seem to take pains to be critical but kind  (for example, user harmony burrell
  posted 6 years ago: “good but skipped words and u shouldnt turn it into like pop
  just sing it how it should be but faster bravo good tone”); others indicate a familiarity
  with the performer''s voice and growth as a singer. She performes the first verse
  only. '

narrative: 'Villegas performs the song in front of a wall on which hangs a framed
  image. She appears to be in a home environment. Comments on the video critique her
  performance; some seem to take pains to be critical but kind (for example, user
  “harmony burrell” posted 6 years ago: “good but skipped words and u shouldnt turn
  it into like pop just sing it how it should be but faster bravo good tone”); other
  comments indicate a familiarity with the performer’s voice and growth as a singer.
  She performs the first verse only.'

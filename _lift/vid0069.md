narrative: 'The video was directed by Debbie Allen. It begins with a monologue by
  Louis Gossett, Jr. The video features noted African American singers such as Dionne
  Warwick, BeBe Winans, Jeffrey Osborne, Bobby Brown (who also dances), and others
  (featured on Melba Moore’s album, “Soul Exposed”), and includes dancing by Jasmine
  Guy. All of the performers are dressed in white and are positioned in front of a
  fuchsia background with light blue steps on which they stand or sit. Three to four
  male dancers accompany Guy. A small chorus of children, also dressed in white, joins
  the singers and dancers. Only the first and third verses of the song are performed
  (See Jessika Banzouzi, Aloe Blacc). The video ends with Gossett intoning, “keep
  hope alive.” As noted in a previous entry, Moore returns to the idea of a communal
  performance with this arrangement. Allen’s video broadens this communal work to
  include movement, building on the idea of embodied performance and embedding a dance
  lexicon in this video. '

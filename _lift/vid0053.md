  one of America's most prestigious Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs).
  Founded in 1891 at the State College for Colored Students, DSU takes pride in its
  heritage as one of the country's first land-grant educational institutions, rooted
  early on in agriculture and education. Our current undergraduate population includes
  a 68 percent African-American enrollment and an increasing number of Caucasian,
  Hispanic, Asian and other international students.\n\nToday DSU offers 54 undergraduate
  degree programs, in fields ranging from education, healthcare, optics and aviation.
  It offers 24 masters' degrees including graduate programs in molecular and cellular
  neuroscience and teaching English as a second language. We offer five doctoral degree
  programs in areas such as interdisciplinary applied mathematics/mathematical physics
  and educational leadership. DSU has190 faculty members within 21 academic departments.
  174 faculty members possess a PhD or a terminal degree. The student-to-faculty ratio
  is 13:1.\n\nDelaware State University is ranked 17th among 80 Historically Black
  Universities and Colleges in the country by U.S. News & World Report.\n\nDelaware
  State University was named by G.I. Jobs magazine as a Military Friendly School for
  2011! This honor ranks the University in the top 15 percent of all colleges, universities
  and trade schools nationwide.\n\nCurrently, there are 17 NCAA Division I sports
  at DSU. Varsity teams compete in baseball, men's and women's basketball, women's
  bowling, football, cross country, indoor and outdoor track and field, tennis, volleyball,
  softball, equestrian and soccer. In addition, our cheerleaders are the pep and step
  at campus sporting events, fundraisers and pep rallies and are role models for campus
  spirit. \n\nThe Hornet football team ranked first in the MEAC division in 2007 with
  an undefeated conference record of 8--0. In 2007--08 the Hornets football and softball
  teams won MEAC Championship titles. The Lady Hornet basketball team won the 2007
  MEAC Tournament and made its first appearance in the NCAA Tournament. The DSU bowling
  team has won back-to-back MEAC championships and competed in the NCAA championship
  tournament in each of the last two years. \n\nDSU is home to the nationally renowned
  Approaching Storm Marching Band."
narrative: Video appears to have been shot with a shaky camera or camera phone. At
  the opening sound of the music, the audience begins to rise and an audience member
  utters, “Oh Lord.” All three verses are performed. The third verse is performed
  much slower and much quieter than the previous verses, as in the form of a prayer.
  However, at “lest our feet...” it once again picks up both in tempo and volume.
  And the performance ends with “Amen.”

narrative: 'The video features the cover of Moore''s 1990 album, “Soul Exposed,” from
  which the song (it is the fifth track on the album) is taken. This version begins
  with Moore noting that she loves singing the song, but that she did not want to
  sing it alone anymore, so she invited a few friends to do so with her. “Let freedom
  ring” echoes throughout the song. She is accompanied first by piano, but as the
  song progresses, she is joined by other voices and instruments, building the song
  from a solo speaking voice to a group of voices and instruments; in a sense, this
  performance returns us the idea of communal performance of the song as it was originally
  imagined by Johnson. Various artists take turn in a call-and response style (“Sing
  a song”). Singers include: Dionne Warwick, Stevie Wonder, The Clark Sisters, Freddie
  Jackson, Anita Baker, Bobby Brown, Howard Hewett, Take 6, Stephanie Mills, BeBe
  and CeCe Winans, and Jeffrey Osborne. Only the first verse is performed.'

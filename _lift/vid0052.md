narrative: Former Congresswoman Barbara Jordan performs with the Royal Philharmonic
  Orchestra of London on this 1979 album, “Symphonic Spirituals.” The orchestra is
  conducted by Dr. Paul Freeman; the performance features soloist William Brown, tenor
  (information from album cover) and recitation by Jordan. Jordan provides a preamble
  to the dramatic recitation of the song, in which she intones, “These are our songs
  of joy and sadness. They were given life by slaves who toiled in the fields of America.
  Sweat on their brows, hope in their hearts. These are our songs of happiness and
  sorrow. The soul of blackfolk, coupled with religious fervor and vigorous rhythms
  that hint of their African heritage. These are our songs of hope.” The video features
  various still images of Jordan. She performs the first and second verses, and changes
  some of the lyrics and adds her own “prayer” to the performance. We might consider
  Jordan’s performance on this album as a preamble to René Marie’s controversial creative
  re-composition of the National Anthem in Denver (2008).

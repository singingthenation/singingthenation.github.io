  known as the “black national anthem.”\n\ntheGrio's Deputy Editor, Natasha Alford,
  breaks down the story behind the 100+ year old hymn and its meaning to our culture.

narrative: Journalist Natasha Alford, Deputy Editor at theGrio, looks at the history
  of the song; the video includes interviews with Black people on the street, one
  of whom asks if it is “an old slave song or something.” Others interviewed note
  that they sang it in church or were familiar with the song through schools (HBCUs)
  and sporting events. The video looks at some performances culled from YouTube (some
  of which are featured in this collection). According to Alford, “Lift Every Voice
  and Sing” is significant to African Americans because it tells a story of “struggle,
  triumph, and freedom.” Several of those interviewed for this story sing a portion
  of the first verse.

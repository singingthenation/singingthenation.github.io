  This is one of my favorite hymns, originally written in 1900 in honor of Booker T. Washington by James Weldon Johnson, the principal of a segregated school, and set to music by his brother John Rosamond Johnson. It has since come to be known as the U.S. Civil Rights Anthem or the African-American National Anthem. I upload it today in remembrance of what would have been The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.’s 83rd birthday.

  This is a recording that I made about four years ago. The sound quality isn't the best and I mispronounced the word “chastening,” but I hope you will enjoy it anyway.

  Dr. King, it is so sad that you were taken from us at the young age of 39, but your legacy lives on. May we be less quick to turn to violence as an instrument of social change. May we continue to teach our eyes to look past the outward appearance and discern the content of one's character. May your dream become a reality.
narrative: Recorded by PianoManT, this video features a blue screen over which the
  lyrics and subtitles appear. The video calls “Lift Every Voice and Sing” the “U.S.
  Civil Rights Anthem,” locating it in a particular historical moment. An opening
  screen features the name of Martin Luther King, Jr., his biographical dates, and
  the note, “May we never forget.” The song appears to be sung over a track with backing
  vocals that echo the main line. The singer's voice also appears to have been digitally
  altered. All three verses are sung.

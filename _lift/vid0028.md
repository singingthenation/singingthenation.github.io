video_title: " Aretha Franklin (LIVE)"
video_notes: Lift every voice and sing ‘Til earth and heaven ring Ring with the harmony
  of Liberty Let our rejoicing rise High as the listening skies Let it resound loud
  as the rolling sea Sing a song full of the faith That our dark past has taught us
  Sing a song full of the hope That the present has brought us Facing the rising sun
  Of a new day begun Let us march on 'til victory is won!
narrative: 'This is a video of Aretha Franklin performing "Lift Every Voice and Sing"
  on 2Live station. The video indicates the time is 12:17 p.m. at the beginning of
  the performance, which takes place in an auditorium or hall. Franklin rephrases
  the song, “ring with the harmony of dignity”; she also transposes some lines and
  calls on the audience to sing: “Everyone sing...” She sings only the first verse.'

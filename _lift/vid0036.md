video_notes: This arrangement was created by Lawrence Watson and produced by Miklos
  Malek. It was first inspired by a late night at “Turner's Fisheries” a cabaret that
  once existed in the Westin Hotel in Boston. That Night Larry Watson, Billy Kilson,
  Vince Evans and Archie Kubota were improvising and Larry Watson started to sing
  this Anthem. Watson has sung the song all over the world. He associates this arrangement
  with the release of Nelson Mandela from 27 years of incarceration. Recently Larry
  Watson provided the entertainment for the kick off fundraiser for Governor Patrick’s
  re election. President Obama was the key note speaker and Watson got to shake his
  hand. Two history makers in the room at the same time. “Let us March on Till Victory
  is won.”
narrative: The video begins with an image of Shepard Fairey's iconic poster from Barack
  Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign. It then segues into images of a Black family
  and another of Black children seemingly caught in mid-song. Images range from iconic
  Black leaders and celebrities (W.E.B. Du Bois, Aretha Franklin--and her hat, Martin
  Luther King, Jr., Michael Jackson), Black college graduates in regalia, images from
  the Civil Rights Movement, and more. The images flash by quickly, seemingly in an
  attempt to capture the scope of the Black experience from life on the continent
  to U.S. chattel slavery to Obama’s road to the White House. The video concludes
  with an image of the Obama family posed in front of a U.S. presidential seal. The
  video appears to have been created and uploaded by Watson in observation of Black
  Music Month. He performs all three verses.

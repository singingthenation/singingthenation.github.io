  get this uploaded! Hope you guys enjoy it :D....
narrative: Uploaded in 2013 by Kuena, who performs in the video. This is a self-recorded
  upload, in which Kuena performs the first verse of the song, in observation of Juneteenth.
  She notes in the video that she is recording it 11 p.m., which is "late" for her,
  but that she "needed to record it...because today is a very special day in history."
  Kuena's commitment to observe Juneteenth through her performance of "Lift Every
  Voice and Sing," highlights the ways in which the song is understood to be a sonic
  attendant to observations of historic events significant to African Americans

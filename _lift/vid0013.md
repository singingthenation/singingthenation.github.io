narrative: A 2012 video duet on Centric, BeBe Winans sings the first verse of the
  song. Knight emerges in the final lines of the Winans's first verse, to audience
  applause. She performs the second verse. Toward the end of her verse, the camera
  pans to the audience, which is shown standing. Some people applaud and cheer. Tap
  dancers, the Manzari Brothers, accompany Winans and Knight. “Sing a song...,” repeated,
  becomes part of the chorus. Knight and Winans perform in front of an American flag
  projected on a large screen. The stage is bathed in soft lavender, purple, and green
  hues. The third verse is not sung.

narrative: BeBe Winans sings the first verse of the song. Knight emeges in the final
  lines of the first verse, to audience applause. She performs the second verse. Toward
  the end of her verse, the camera pans to the audience, shown standing. Some people
  applaud and cheer. Manzari Brothers, tap dancers, accompany Winans and Knight. “Sing
  a song,” repeated, becomes the chorus. They perform in front of an American flag
  projected on a large screen. The third verse is not sung.

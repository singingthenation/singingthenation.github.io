video_title: "“Lift Every Voice and Sing”"
video_notes: In honor of Martin Luther King Day, MPrynt sings a special rendition
  of the Black National Anthem
narrative: 'MPrynt, a four-part-harmony group delivers an a cappella performance.
  The group recorded the song in observation of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.''s birthday.
  The song appears to have been recorded in a building hallway (possibly a school
  or apartment building). One commenter (Roscoe J, comments section) notes the irony
  of the juxtaposition of sounds: of sirens in the background, playing underneath
  the melody of the Black men''s voices. User Prince Philipps responds “gave me chills.”
  The group sings only the first verse.'

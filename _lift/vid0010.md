video_notes: Cedric Caldwell, Published May 26, 2013. Behind-the-Scenes look at the
  “Making of Lift Every Voice & Sing” by the Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet
narrative: This is a documentary film that looks behind the scenes of the Pearl Cohn
  Entertainment Magnet School's performance of “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” The film
  features interviews with students and faculty; an excerpt of a speech by former
  President Barack Obama (video by DimeWars). There is an emphasis on researching
  other performances that existed in order to make “our authentic version.” The documentary
  includes a video compilation of other performances (some of which are included in
  this collection). Significantly, the video also includes performances by everyday
  African Americans--in parks, on the street, in schools, and in other locales, emphasizing
  the songs’ relationship to the everyday. Finally, the video takes us behind the
  scenes to look at the technologies involved in the “sonic process”--recording, editing,
  cutting, storyboarding--so that the song flows seamlessly.

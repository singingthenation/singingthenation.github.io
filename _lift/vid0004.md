video_title: "“Lift Every Voice and Sing” - The Wardlaw Brothers"
video_notes: Black history month is a month set aside for us to reflect on the past
  from which we've come. Black History Month is very important to not only the African
  American Race, but to all races. So many years have passed and still there are a
  great number of us who are filled with hatred and envy. The dream of Dr. Martin
  Luther King Jr. has certainly come true in many areas, however, we are still not
  there - and we have a long way to go. Let us love one another and please keep the
  'dream' alive.
narrative: 'The mashup opens with an image of The Wardlaw Brothers’ album cover, God’s
  Been There. The video features footage of Martin Luther King and other Civil Rights
  activists marching and singing, “We Shall Overcome.” Additional archival images
  and film footage such as the March on Washington, images of significant African
  American figures such as Shirley Chisholm, Colin Powell, Mae Jemison, President
  Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama, among others, also appears. Only the
  first and third verses of “Lift Every Voice and Sing” are performed. '

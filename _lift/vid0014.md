  1900 by James and John Johnson. Sung by Wintley Phipps. Photos by Hans Silvester,The
  Malcolm X Estate, and other images gathered through Google search engine. I do not

  song.
narrative: 'This video opens with a geographical image of map of Africa, the Middle
  East, and Southern Europe. Various other images are presented, beginning with the
  map of Africa. Other images look to chart a narrative of movement of Africans across
  the Atlantic, from Africa to the U.S. The images narrate a history of African Americans
  from slavery through the contemporary (of slave ships, slaves plotting insurrection,
  African American soldiers). The video concludes with an image of a two-lane highway
  winding through desert mountains, with blue skies overhead. The video uploader provides
  sources for the materials used: Hans Silvester, the Malcolm X Estate, and Google''s
  search engine. Phipps sings the first and third verses of “Lift Every Voice and
  Sing.”'
rights: The uploader indicates provenance for photos of Malcolm X. Disclaims ownership
  of images and music.

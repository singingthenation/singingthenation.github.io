video_title: Aloe Blacc feat. The String Queens
video_notes: It’s called the Black National Anthem. First penned as a poem in 1900,
  Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing is the melodic cornerstone of the African-American experience—a
  quiet but steadfast declaration of the pain and resilience of our ancestors. In
  a moment in time when the very word anthem stirs debate and controversy, Lift E’vry
  Voice and Sing is singular and unmistakable in its message of hope. Filmed on the
  grounds of the Monticello, Thomas Jefferson’s former plantation, Aloe Blacc’s modern-day
  rendition speaks to the struggle today in the new civil rights era, with a brilliant
  reimagining of what the present offers and the future holds.
narrative: 'The song begins with a reading of the last verse of Maya Angelou''s poem,
  “Still I Rise.” The video, filmed at Thomas Jefferson''s Monticello, begins with
  a close shot of Aloe Blacc; it then segues to a group of five children, beautifully
  adorned, who emerge from a building and run across the grounds of Monticello, giggling.
  The String Queens, dressed in white, gently seated on a powder blue settee stationed
  in front of Monticello, play. A small choir, dressed in red, joins Aloe Blacc as
  he moves through the space--between main house and slave dwellings. Only the first
  verse is performed in this arrangement. '

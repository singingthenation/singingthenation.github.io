narrative: This a trailer for the 2015 documentary film, “Rosenwald” (Aviva Kempner,
  dir.). “Lift Every Voice and Sing” plays in the background. This trailer is included
  in the collection to demonstrate one of the many ways in which the song functions
  as a mnemonic device, as a kind of shorthand for calling up a particular history.
  The film documents the creation of more than 5,000 schools throughout the South,
  funded by Jewish philanthropist, Julius Rosenwald.

video_notes: 'In 2008 Rene Marie was asked to sing the National Anthem at Denver''s
  State of the City address. The outcome was Rene singing “Lift Ev''ry Voice and Sing”,
  “the black national anthem” to the tune of The Star Spangled Banner. This caused
  a firestorm of controversy. This clip is taken from Rene Marie''s performance the
  Bridgestone Music Festival. Her version of “Lift Ev''ry Voice & Sing/ Star Spangled
  Banner” can be found on her Motema album “Voice of My Beautiful Country”:'
narrative: René Marie performs live at the Bridgestone Music Festival in 2009. In
  this composition, which she titles “Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing”/Star-Spangled Banner,"
  she sings the first verse of “Lift Every Voice and Sing,” her unique remixing of
  the song to the tune of “The Star-Spangled Banner.” She then segues into a jazz
  rendition of the American National Anthem (first verse); she returns to “Lift Every
  Voice and Sing.” She repeats “let us march on/ ... till victory is won” in call-and-response
  with the band.

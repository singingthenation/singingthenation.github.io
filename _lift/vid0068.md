  On May 20, 2018, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) attended the Mormon Tabernacle Choir’s weekly Music and the Spoken Word broadcast. Members of the National Board of Directors of the NAACP and the NAACP Foundation were in Salt Lake City for their board meetings, which were held in Salt Lake City for the first time. They also met with the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and made a joint statement to the media calling for “greater civility and racial harmony.”

  “Lift Every Voice and Sing” was written in 1900, when a school principal and poet, James Weldon Johnson, was invited to speak to a crowd in Jacksonville, Florida, for the anniversary of Abraham Lincoln’s birthday. To introduce the honored guest, Booker T. Washington, Johnson decided to write a poem. On February 12, 1900, 500 schoolchildren at the segregated Stanton School in Jacksonville, where Johnson was principal, recited “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” Stanton's brother John wrote the music to accompany the poem in 1905.

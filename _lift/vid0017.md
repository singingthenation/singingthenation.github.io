  The PS22 Chorus is not a middle, intermediate, or high school group.  It is comprised
  of about 70 public elementary school fifth graders from New York City.  Visit our
  above website for more!.
narrative: A chorus of school children accompany a soloist, Justin. The children wear
  oversized t-shirts--some orange, some light green--which indicate the parts they
  will sing (alto, soprano,etc.). Justin sings soprano. The chorus and Justin engage
  in call-and-response. Some adults in the school auditorium stand. Children and adults
  cheer loudly when Justin hits a high note. They sing only the first verse.

narrative: 'This video appears to have been created by an audience member, seated
  at a distance (possibly balcony). The children begin to sing and are joined by additional
  members onstage. Most of the children are dressed in white button-down shirts, red
  tie and vest, and black pants or skirts. Some members of the group wear white, button-down
  shirts and black pants. The children''s choir sings only the first verse of the
  song. '

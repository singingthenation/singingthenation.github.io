narrative: This short video of Houston performing a portion of “Lift Every Voice and
  Sing” on the television show, “Entertainment Tonight” with host, Leeza Gibbons.
  Houston is dressed in white, including a white hat, and performs as the credits
  roll quickly across the screen. She hums along to the music before finally saying,
  “I forgot the words.” However, she uses the music to locate the end of the first
  verse, belting out, “facing the rising sun...” A digitized version of the American
  flag flashes across the screen. Filmed in 1988.

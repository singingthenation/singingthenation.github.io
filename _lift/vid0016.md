  Church Cathedral Choir, conducted by Derrick James. The video was produced and donated

narrative: This video features video and image montages. It includes images of the
  pyramids of Egypt, and like the video posted by fieryrabbit87 (Wintley Phipps performance)
  charts a history of African American experiences--from the continent to slave ships
  to plantations and freedom marches to the contemporary. It features clips from the
  videotaped beating of Rodney King, Hurricane Katrina, and the Obama victory, among
  others. The lyrics, “true to our native land” is superimposed over the video of
  President Obama's victory speech in Chicago (2008). A final image sees Obama, arms
  folded, with the seal of the presidential office behind him, the words “MR PRESIDENT”
  superimposed. All verses are performed.

video_notes: This video of the “Negro National Anthem” was originally screened at
  the historic African-American Church Inaugural Ball in Washington, DC on January
  18th, 2009. Many of the esteemed individuals featured in this video were in attendance
  and were presented with the “Keepers of the Flame” award for their monumental contributions

  Church Cathedral Choir, conducted by Derrick James. The video was produced and donated
  by Ascender Communications, LLC (www.ascender-c.com) at the request of The Balm
  In Gilead, Inc.
narrative: This video features video and image montages. It includes images of the
  pyramids of Egypt, and like the video posted by fieryrabbit87 (Wintley Phipps performance)
  charts a history of African American experiences--from the continent to slave ships
  to plantations and freedom marches to the contemporary. It features clips from the
  video-taped beating of Rodney King, Hurricane Katrina victims, the Obama victory.
  The lyrics, “true to our native land” is superimposed over the video of President
  Obama's victory speech in Chicago (2008). A final image sees Obama, arms folded,
  with the seal of the presidential office behind him, the words “MR PRESIDENT” superimposed.
  All verses are performed.

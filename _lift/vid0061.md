narrative: 'Bullock performs both “The Start-Spangled Banner” and “Lift Every Voice
  and Sing,” January 18, 2009, one year after Rene Marie''s controversial fusing of
  “Lift Every Voice and Sing''s” text with the music of the American National Anthem.
  An announcer is heard intoning, “please remain standing for ‘The Black National
  Anthem.’''" One woman in the background sings along. Bullock sings only the first
  verse of each song. '

narrative: Ray Charles and the Raelettes performing on the Dick Cavett show in 1972.
  The song is performed in a call and response form. The five members of The Raelettes
  are arranged around the piano, dressed in loose, pastel-colored chiffon gowns (yellow,
  blue, green lavender) that seem reminiscent of choir robes. The performance is uptempo.Charles
  (like Jessika Banzouzi) sings only the first and third verses. Charles ends with
  “Amen to that.”

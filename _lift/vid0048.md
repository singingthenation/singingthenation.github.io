narrative: Ray Charles and the Raelettes performing on the Dick Cavett show in 1972.
  The song is performed in a call-and-response style. The five members of the Raelettes
  are arranged around the piano, dressed in loose, pastel-colored gowns (yellow, blue,
  green, lavender) that seem reminiscent of choir robes. The performance style is
  uptempo. Ray Charles (like Jessika Banzouzi) sings only the first and third verses.
  Charles ends the performance with “Amen to that.”

narrative: 'The choir is dressed in black (with some female singers wearing burgundy-colored
  skirts). All members of the congregation stand as the pianist introduces the first
  strains of the song. Roland M. Carter, conducts both the choir and the congregation;
  on occasion, he also sings, guiding them to the words. The arrangement begins with
  call and response, in which the congregation sings the main text and the choir responds
  with “lift every voice and sing,” then blending to sing together. Carter then indicates
  that the congregation return to their seats, while the choir continues the song.
  They sing all three verses. The choir begins the third verse a cappella and is joined
  later by the pianist. At the conclusion of the song, the congregation/audience stands
  and applauds. '

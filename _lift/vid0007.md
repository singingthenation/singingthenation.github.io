narrative: This video is an excerpt from the documentary film, “Music Makes Us,” about
  the Pearl-Cohn Entertainment Magnet High School's interpretation and performance
  of “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” The song features student performer and sings the
  threads of Martin Luther King Jr.'s “let it ring” and “let freedom ring (all over
  the world)”; the performance ends with an original rap beginning at 5:13, followed
  by an a capella performance of the chorus, “we keep marching on/ till victory is
  won.”

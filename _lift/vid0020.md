narrative: Green appears to be performing in his home, possibly the bathroom (acoustics
  and background images provide a clue). His performance marks Martin Luther King,
  Jr.'s birthday. He refers to the song as “The Black National Anthem” and invokes
  the memory of his grandmother teaching him the song as a child from the “Songs of
  Zion” hymnals. He sings all three verses of the song.

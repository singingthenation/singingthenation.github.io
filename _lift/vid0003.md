narrative: Although it is titled "instrumental" this video mashup is not strictly
  so. A chorus of "let it ring" begins at 1:24 and various portions of the song are
  performed. It is more of a meditation or an evocation. And "Lift Every Voice and
  Sing" is never sung. The video opens with a photo montage of significant Black figures
  such as Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jr., Muhammad Ali,
  Oprah Winfrey with the Obamas, Nelson Mandela, and Medgar Evers, among others. The
  video also features quotes by MLK, Malcolm X, and Nat Turner (from Thomas Gray's
  The Confessions of Nat Turner). Some of the quotes feature images and are drawn
  from sources such as izquotes.com and InspirationBoost.com. The video creator, Aubery
  Reed III, highlights the labor in creating the video, noting that they worked on
  it "till almost 2 in the morning" and created it to honor Black History Month. Reed
  makes a request for comments and "rates" as encouragement from viewers to continue
  creating.

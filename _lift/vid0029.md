video_title: Obama Inauguration Tribute
video_notes: 'Since I cannot attend the Inauguration, here is my own personal tribute
  to and celebration of — as a Black man and a proud citizen — the historic election
  of Barack Obama as President of the United States, an event I never thought I would
  live to see in my lifetime. Historic African Americans and Others Featured (in order):
  Crispus Attucks, Dred Scott, Nat Turner, Harriet Tubman, John Brown, Frederick Douglass,
  Abraham Lincoln, Madam CJ Walker, WEB Dubois, Booker T Washington, Marcus Garvey,
  Jack Johnson, Jackie Robinson, Dr. Charles Drew, Rosa Park, Malcolm X, Marian Anderson,
  Martin Luther King Jr, Muhammad Ali, Shirley Chisholm, and Mae Jemison “Life Every
  Voice And Sing” aka “The Negro National Anthem” - Video Edit (written by James Weldon
  Johnson) Lift every voice and sing, till earth and heaven ring, Ring with the harmonies
  of liberty; Let our rejoicing rise High as the listening skies, Let it resound loud
  as the rolling sea. Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught
  us, Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us; facing the rising
  sun of our new day begun, let us march on till victory is won. Stony the road we
  trod, bitter the chastening rod, felt in the days when hope unborn had died; yet
  with a steady beat, have not our weary feet come to the place for which our fathers
  died? We have come over a way that with tears have been watered, We have come, treading
  our path through the blood of the slaughtered, out from the gloomy past, till now
  we stand at last where the white gleam of our bright star is cast. Lest our feet
  stray from the places, our God, where we met thee; lest our hearts drunk with the
  wine of the world, we forget thee, shadowed beneath thy hand, may we forever stand,
  true to our God, true to our native land. ---------------------- The content of
  this video comes from different sources and the figures, incidents and historic
  references are meant only as a broad and general overview of Black American Historic
  Fugures, NOT an exhaustive survey. (in other words, if you believe that some people
  should have been featured and others omitted, that really isn''t the point of this
  tribute.) Music: “Lift Every Voice and Sing” also known as “The Negro National Anthem,”
  performed by the Boston Pops. (No copyright infringement intended; for entertainment

narrative: 'This video is a mashup created by DS9Sisko, who uses archival images and
  materials (newspaper clippings, postcards) to narrate the experiences of African
  Americans from the slave ships to the Obama presidency. He writes that that he created
  the video because he could not attend the inauguration but wanted to mark it in
  some way. The video ends with an image of the American flag undulating in the wind,
  against a clear blue sky and sharp white clouds. The video features images of all
  U.S. presidents. It ends with two lines, super-imposed on the video: 1. “how far
  we''ve come” and 2. “with miles yet to go.” The video is interesting for several
  reasons, but here I will just mention one: the user''s moniker, DS9Sisko, which
  references “Star Trek: Deep Space Nine” and the space station''s captain, Benjamin
  Sisko, played by Avery Brooks. Brooks''s character served as a model for African
  Americans, marking his appearance as a major, positive representations of Black
  masculinity and Black fatherhood in media. All three verses of the song are performed
  by Boston Pops Orchestra.'

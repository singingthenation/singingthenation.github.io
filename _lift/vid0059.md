video_notes: "“Lift Every Voice” (The Black National Anthem)”. (Lyrics)\n\nFOR PROMOTIONAL
  USE ONLY...I DO NOT OWN ANY RIGHTS TO THIS SONG\n\nLyrics:\n\nLift ev'ry voice and
  sing,\nTill earth and heaven ring.\nRing with the harmonies of Liberty;\nLet our
  rejoicing rise,\nHigh as the list'ning skies,\nLet it resound loud as the rolling
  sea.\nSing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,\nSing a song
  full of the hope that the present has brought us;\nFacing the rising sun of our
  new day begun,\nLet us march on \nooo on (We got keep marching yea)\noh on (Until
  we find our victory)\noh on (Yeah)\noh on\n\n(I know you've been hurting)\noh on
  (And I know you've been struggling)\noh on (But you got hold on)\noh on (Keep on
  marching on)\n\n(I know you've been waiting)\noh on (And you've been pressing on)\noh
  on (But you've gotta keep moving)\noh on (Yes, keep on moving)\noh on\n\nLet us
  march on (Amazing grace)\nLet us march on (How sweet the sound)\nLet us march on
  (That saved)\nLet us march on (A wretch like me yeah)\n\nLet us march on (I once
  was lost)\nLet us march on (But now I'm found)\nLet us march on (I once was blind)\nLet
  us march on (But now I see)\n\nLet us march on\nTill victory is won.\n(March on,
  march on)"
narrative: 'This video features a dark grey background with RESOUND printed in light
  grey. The three members of the group (two female, one male) perform only the first
  verse before they segue into their own text, which repeats “let us march on,” as
  other performances have also done. '

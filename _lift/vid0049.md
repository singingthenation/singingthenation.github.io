video_title: Black National Anthem
video_notes: This is Kim Weston signing the Black National Anthem at Watts Stax in
  1973. For those who do not know Kim Weston was a Motown Artist who did a duet with
  Singer Marvin Gaye.
narrative: This video is a mashup, which features Kim Weston being introduced by Jesse
  Jackson at Wattstax in 1972. The video features shots of the crowd, followed by
  images that attempt to chronicle the experiences of Black Americans from slavery
  to the contemporary. At 2:31, the video cuts from Weston’s singing to a clip of
  Martin Luther King Jr. “Mountaintop” speech (through 3:44). Sonically, the video
  then segues into a performance of “Somebody Bigger Than You & I” (the performer
  is Jimmy Jones, however, multiple versions were recorded by Elvis Presley, Whitney
  Houston, Mahalia Jackson, and numerous others). Only the first verse of “Lift Every
  Voice” is sung.

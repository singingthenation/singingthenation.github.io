narrative: 'The video is a mashup featuring a photo montage of various historical
  figures, mostly related to the civil rights movement: Martin Luther King, Jr., Bayard
  Rustin, and President Lyndon Johnson; it also features several quotes and images
  of King. All images are unsourced. The video ends with a photo of the MLK memorial
  and a final image of King, with a quote: “The hope of a secure and livable world
  lies with disciplined noncomformists who are dedicated to Justice, Peace, and Brotherhood.”
  Only the first and third verses are sung. '

video_title: Rene Marie's Lift Every Voice
video_notes: At the start of the event, City Council President Michael Hancock introduced
  singer Rene Marie to perform the national anthem. Instead, she performed the song
  “Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing” to the tune of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
narrative: A news report of Rene Marie's controversial performance of “Lift Every
  Voice and Sing”/“The Star-Spangled Banner.” One commentator is male, the other,
  female. The male news reporter describes the audience's response to Rene Marie's
  performance as “tepid applause.” The video features an image of the song sheet,
  onto which various images of Marie's performance, the singer's album covers, and
  images from the Civil Rights Movement and U.S. history (images of Klan members in
  robes, for example) are projected. It also features photos of Marcus Garvey in UNIA
  regalia, a photo of Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali (Malcolm X's three daughters are
  pictured, with the youngest sitting on Ali's lap). The video ends with an image
  of Barack Obama, superimposed on the Pan African Flag, segueing into an image of
  Johnson, with the lyrics of “Lift Every Voice and Sing.”

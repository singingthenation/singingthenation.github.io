video_title: Rene Marie's Lift Every Voice (Black National Anthem)
video_notes: At the start of the event, City Council President Michael Hancock introduced
  singer Rene Marie to perform the national anthem. Instead, she performed the song
  “Lift Ev’ry Voice and Sing” to the tune of “The Star-Spangled Banner.”
narrative: This video is a news report of Rene Marie's controversial performance of
  “Lift Every Voice and Sing”/“The Star-Spangled Banner.” One commentator is male,
  the other, female. The male news reporter describes the audience's response to Rene
  Marie's performance as “tepid applause.” The video features an image of the song
  sheet, onto which various images of Marie's performance, the singer’s album covers,
  and images from the Civil Rights Movement and U.S. history (images of Klan members
  in robes, for example) are projected. The video also features photos of Marcus Garvey
  in UNIA regalia, a photo of Malcolm X and Muhammad Ali ( which features three of
  Malcolm X’s daughters, the youngest of whom sits on Ali’s lap). The video ends with
  an image of Barack Obama, superimposed on the Pan African Flag, segueing into an
  image of Johnson, with the lyrics of “Lift Every Voice and Sing.”

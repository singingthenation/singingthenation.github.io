video_notes: "Sydney Tompkins performs “Lift Every Voice and Sing” on LINK. Sydney
  was a student of Wayne Winston, director of Non-Stop Production (NSP,Inc.) in Bedford-Stuyvesant,
  Brooklyn. LINK, everyday dramas in the lives of African Americans, is produced by
  La-Verne Cody Gittens.\n\n‘THE NEGRO NATIONAL ANTHEM’\n\nLift every voice and sing\nTill
  earth and heaven ring,\nRing with the harmonies of Liberty;\nLet our rejoicing rise\nHigh
  as the listening skies,\nLet it resound loud as the rolling sea.\nSing a song full
  of the faith that the dark past has taught us,\nSing a song full of the hope that
  the present has brought us,\nFacing the rising sun of our new day begun\nLet us
  march on till victory is won.\n\nStony the road we trod,\nBitter the chastening
  rod,\nFelt in the days when hope unborn had died;\nYet with a steady beat,\nHave
  not our weary feet\nCome to the place for which our fathers sighed?\nWe have come
  over a way that with tears have been watered,\nWe have come, treading our path through
  the blood of the slaughtered,\nOut from the gloomy past,\nTill now we stand at last\nWhere
  the white gleam of our bright star is cast.\n\nGod of our weary years,\nGod of our
  silent tears,\nThou who has brought us thus far on the way;\nThou who has by Thy
  might\nLed us into the light,\nKeep us forever in the path, we pray.\nLest our feet
  stray from the places, Our God, where we met Thee;\nLest, our hearts drunk with
  the wine of the world, we forget Thee;\nShadowed beneath Thy hand,\nMay we forever
  stand.\nTrue to our GOD,\nTrue to our native land \n\nJames Weldon Johnson June

narrative: The video is a close-up of a young girl singing. At times the video focuses
  on her eyes only. She changes some of the words to the song, for example, “sing
  with the harmony of victory” rather than “liberty.” Comments are generally positive
  and encouraging, with one or two correcting the changed words. She sings only the
  first verse.

video_notes: Rene Marie performs live mash-up of “Lift Every Voice and Sing” with
  American national anthem. Stirring, ironic, powerful. What a magnificent performance.
  Please share.
narrative: René Marie performs “Lift Every Voice and Sing” in Denver at then-Mayor
  John Hickenlooper's State of the City address. Marie is mistakenly introduced as
  “Rene Martin,” before the mostly white audience. She performs the first verse only,
  after which, there was a smattering of applause. This video is the first I encountered
  in my research on Marie's performance and the ensuing controversy.

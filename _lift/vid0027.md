video_notes: Here are six Christian men from Orlando, Florida, whose God, the 7th
  Element, has called them to minister to others, to reach peoples’ hearts with a
  positive message in music. David ‘Dee’ Glover, Marc Dwyer, Darren Greene, Garth,
  Curt and Kevin perform their mission well. In a way, 7th Element has actually been
  in the making for decades. “Four of the guys in the group, Garth, Kevin, Darren
  and Curt Greene, are brothers. it's clear as they break into a stunning harmonic
  jazz chord that 7th Element is something very special. Vol. I album, has several
  songs written and arranged by the group members, with very cool with little spoken
  set pieces.Beautiful, soaring falsetto voices and cutting edge arrangements make
  'Vol. I' as impressive as any well accomplished a cappella group. Volume One, has
  already drawn comparisons to multi-GRAMMY winning and platinum-selling artist, Take
  6, and garnering high praise for expanding Take 6's legacy by venturing into new
  and cutting-edge forms. When it came time to choose a name for their new group,
  the members of 7th Element wanted the glory going to Christ rather than to themselves
  as individuals. Marc comments, “We figured that each of us came together to be an
  important element in the harmony, but the most important one was the Lord. So, each
  of us took a number, Element one through Element six, and we gave Christ his holy
  number, Element Seven. Thus, the group is named after the 7th Element.” Group members
  felt especially compelled to honor Christ through their name and their music because
  they say none of this would have ever happened without some amazing and timely divine
  intervention. 7th Element's diverse sound, its uncompromising message, and the astounding
  talent of each individual member has already fueled an incredible demand for appearances,
  with requests already pouring in from cities nationwide, as well as from three countries
  in Europe. In addition to their musical pursuits, group members have also set up
  the E7 Youth Development Group, in order to help young people get an education and
  pursue their dreams in music. Every copy of Volume One sold will help fund the non-profit
  organization, which will provide several deserving children each year with the money
  for a Christian education. In addition, the E7 Youth Development Group has a mentorship
  program to help aspiring artists. Group members will sponsor young musicians, flying
  the students to Orlando, taking them to Disney World, giving them a behind-the-scenes
  glimpse of performances, and buying them music equipment of their own to help advance
  their careers. Through their long history, the divine grace that brought them together,
  and their desire to help others through their musical success, the members of 7th
  Element have created a strong new future for themselves, a success story that no
  doubt will have many volumes. As David sums up, “We just want others to understand
  that you don't have to compromise your faith in God to be successful. We are not
  just singers but professionals and family men. We want to be an example through
  our lives, showing others that there is value in doing things the right way, God's
  way. Our youth need to see that. Through our music and the E7 Youth Development
  Group, that's the message we hope to portray.” “Lift every voice and sing, ‘Til
  earth and heaven ring, Ring with the harmonies of Liberty; Let our rejoicing rise
  High as the listening skies, Let it resound loud as the rolling sea. Sing a song
  full of the faith that the dark past has taught us, Sing a song full of the hope
  that the present has brought us; Facing the rising sun of our new day begun, Let
  us march on 'til victory is won. Stony the road we trod, Bitter the chast'ning rod,
  Felt in the days when hope unborn had died; Yet with a steady beat, Have not our
  weary feet Come to the place for which our fathers sighed? We have come over a way
  that with tears has been watered, We have come, treading our path through the blood
  of the slaughtered, Out from the gloomy past, ‘Til now we stand at last Where the
  white gleam of our bright star is cast. God of our weary years, God of our silent
  tears, Thou who has brought us thus far on the way; Thou who has by Thy might Led
  us into the light, Keep us forever in the path, we pray. Lest our feet stray from
  the places, our God, where we met Thee, Lest, our hearts drunk with the wine of
  the world, we forget Thee; Shadowed beneath Thy hand, May we forever stand, True
  to our God, True to our native land.

narrative: Performing in Baltimore, the group serves as the opening act for an R.
  Kelly show. Kristall notes that the group was asked recently to perform the "black
  national anthem" at a celebrity basketball tournament. They had not heard of the
  song before. In this video, they ask the audience to stand; audience members can
  be heard in the background refusing to stand, laughing. Some audience members continue
  to talk throughout the performance. In the comments section, some viewers express
  displeasure at the audience speaking throughout the performance. June's Diary members
  remind the audience to vote. The note refers to the song as the “Negro National
  Anthem.” They sing only the first verse.

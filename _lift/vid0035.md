  Southwest Africa (Namibia) Black National Anthem - James Weldon Johnson During the
  House of the Cultures of the World Panel-Event organized by black and white German
  NGOs to welcome the Namibian Delegation. A group of over 60 people travelled to
  Germany in order to bring home the Human Remains of their Ancestors who were murdered
  among 40-80 000 other Herreros and Namas by white Germans in colonial genocide (
  Völkermord ). The AFROTAK TV cyberNomads Artist and afro-german JESSIKA BANZOUZI
  performed LIFT EVERY VOICE. The spiritual Song by the african-american author James
  Weldon Johnson is also known as the BLACK NATIONAL ANTHEM and was also sung for
  the inauguration of president Obama. LIFT EVERY VOICE Lift every voice and sing,
  till earth and Heaven ring, Ring with the harmonies of liberty; Let our rejoicing
  rise, high as the listening skies, Let it resound loud as the rolling sea. Sing
  a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us, Sing a song full of the
  hope that the present has brought us; Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,
  Let us march on till victory is won. God of our weary years, God of our silent tears,
  Thou Who hast brought us thus far on the way; Thou Who hast by Thy might, led us
  into the light, Keep us forever in the path, we pray. Lest our feet stray from the
  places, our God, where we met Thee. Lest our hearts, drunk with the wine of the
  world, we forget Thee. Shadowed beneath Thy hand, may we forever stand, True to
  our God, true to our native land. *Black National Anthem; Written by: James Weldon

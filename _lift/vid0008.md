narrative: This is an a cappella performance by Committed. The group performed at
  Oakwood University and this is a live recording. The video opens to a black screen
  onto which the five singers fade in. They perform all three verses of “Lift Every
  Voice and Sing.” The video creator notes that the performance was in honor of Black
  History Month. Oakwood University is also home to the Aeolians, another group featured
  in this collection.

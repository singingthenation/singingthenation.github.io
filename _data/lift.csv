The society met every two weeks to get drunk, sing songs and to indulge in some debauchery. Anacreon himself was a Greek poet from about 570BC who was noted for his erotic poetry (...) and his drinking songs.

To Anacreon in Heav'n, where he sat in full glee,
A few sons of harmony sent in a petition
That he their Inspirer and patron would be;
When this answer arriv'd from the Jolly Old Grecian
“Voice, fiddle and flute,
“no longer be mute,
“I'll lend you my name and inspire you to boot,
“And, besides, I'll instruct you, like me, to intwine
“The Myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's Vine.”

(...)

Ye Sons of Anacreon, then join hand in hand;
Preserve unanimity, friendship and love!
'Tis yours to support what's so happily plann'd;
You've the sanction of Gods and the fiat of Jove.
While thus we agree
Our toast let it be:
“May our club flourish happy, united and free!
“And long may the sons of Anacreon intwine

In a way, 7th Element has actually been in the making for decades. “Four of the guys in the group, Garth, Kevin, Darren and Curt Greene, are brothers. it's clear as they break into a stunning harmonic jazz chord that 7th Element is something very special. Vol. I album, has several songs written and arranged by the group members, with very cool with little spoken set pieces.Beautiful, soaring falsetto voices and cutting edge arrangements make 'Vol. I' as impressive as any well accomplished a cappella group. Volume One, has already drawn comparisons to multi-GRAMMY winning and platinum-selling artist, Take 6, and garnering high praise for expanding Take 6's legacy by venturing into new and cutting-edge forms. When it came time to choose a name for their new group, the members of 7th Element wanted the glory going to Christ rather than to themselves as individuals. Marc comments, “We figured that each of us came together to be an important element in the harmony, but the most important one was the Lord. So, each of us took a number, Element one through Element six, and we gave Christ his holy number, Element Seven. Thus, the group is named after the 7th Element.” Group members felt especially compelled to honor Christ through their name and their music because they say none of this would have ever happened without some amazing and timely divine intervention. 7th Element's diverse sound, its uncompromising message, and the astounding talent of each individual member has already fueled an incredible demand for appearances, with requests already pouring in from cities nationwide, as well as from three countries in Europe. In addition to their musical pursuits, group members have also set up the E7 Youth Development Group, in order to help young people get an education and pursue their dreams in music. Every copy of Volume One sold will help fund the non-profit organization, which will provide several deserving children each year with the money for a Christian education. In addition, the E7 Youth Development Group has a mentorship program to help aspiring artists. Group members will sponsor young musicians, flying the students to Orlando, taking them to Disney World, giving them a behind-the-scenes glimpse of performances, and buying them music equipment of their own to help advance their careers. Through their long history, the divine grace that brought them together, and their desire to help others through their musical success, the members of 7th Element have created a strong new future for themselves, a success story that no doubt will have many volumes. As David sums up, “We just want others to understand that you don't have to compromise your faith in God to be successful. We are not just singers but professionals and family men. We want to be an example through our lives, showing others that there is value in doing things the right way, God's way. Our youth need to see that. Through our music and the E7 Youth Development Group, that's the message we hope to portray.” “Lift every voice and sing, ‘Til earth and heaven ring, Ring with the harmonies of Liberty; Let our rejoicing rise High as the listening skies, Let it resound loud as the rolling sea. Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us, Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us; Facing the rising sun of our new day begun, Let us march on 'til victory is won.

I called good friends Al Green and Deniece Williams who agreed to sing the duet, backed by Patti Austin, Roberta Flack, Melba Moore and myself. 
The band consisted of the studio musicians who made up John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd Blues Brothers Band, along with other notable musicians, including the late great Yogi Horton and jazz legend Jon Faddis. One of my favorite arrangers, Leon Pendarvis penned the charts and was Musical Director. Husband and wife actors Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee provided the voice-over narration for the commercials. 
Recorded in New York at Clinton Studios, it started out as a jingle but ended up a full length recording. 

This is the actual video from the recording session. Al was 8 hours late as usual, which is why it's dark when he's arriving. It's a fun-filled sneak peek inside what goes on (or used to go on) in the recording studio. Enjoy!

This is a recording that I made about four years ago. The sound quality isn't the best and I mispronounced the word “chastening,” but I hope you will enjoy it anyway.

Dr. King, it is so sad that you were taken from us at the young age of 39, but your legacy lives on. May we be less quick to turn to violence as an instrument of social change. May we continue to teach our eyes to look past the outward appearance and discern the content of one's character. May your dream become a reality.","Recorded by PianoManT, this video features a blue screen over which the lyrics and subtitles appear.

‘THE NEGRO NATIONAL ANTHEM’

Lift every voice and sing
Till earth and heaven ring,
Ring with the harmonies of Liberty;
Let our rejoicing rise
High as the listening skies,
Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.
Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,
Sing a song full of the hope that the present has brought us,
Facing the rising sun of our new day begun
Let us march on till victory is won.

Stony the road we trod,
Bitter the chastening rod,
Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;
Yet with a steady beat,
Have not our weary feet
Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?
We have come over a way that with tears have been watered,
We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,
Out from the gloomy past,
Till now we stand at last
Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.

God of our weary years,
God of our silent tears,
Thou who has brought us thus far on the way;
Thou who has by Thy might
Led us into the light,
Keep us forever in the path, we pray.
Lest our feet stray from the places, Our God, where we met Thee;
Lest, our hearts drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee;
Shadowed beneath Thy hand,
May we forever stand.
True to our GOD,
True to our native land

They also met with the First Presidency of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and made a joint statement to the media calling for “greater civility and racial harmony.”

“Lift Every Voice and Sing” was written in 1900, when a school principal and poet, James Weldon Johnson, was invited to speak to a crowd in Jacksonville, Florida, for the anniversary of Abraham Lincoln’s birthday. To introduce the honored guest, Booker T. Washington, Johnson decided to write a poem. On February 12, 1900, 500 schoolchildren at the segregated Stanton School in Jacksonville, where Johnson was principal, recited “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” Stanton's brother John wrote the music to accompany the poem in 1905.
